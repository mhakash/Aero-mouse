# Aero Mouse

A wireless bluetooth mouse with 3D motion controls.

This is a wireless mouse that connects with the computer using Bluetooth. The aero mouse controls the pointer with a gyro sensor, allowing us to use the mouse without the need for a surface. This mouse was created as a project of the Microcontroller and Microprocessor course in CSE, BUET.
